# OpenWeather-Gmaps-API-Analysis
This analysis is a two part project using Python and Pandas to pull in data using the OpenWeather and Gmaps APIs. 
In the initial analysis, "WeatherPy", my script pulled in weather data for over 500 cities to analyze certain characteristics. 
Throughtout the analysis, I attempted to determine if there were any correlations or relationships between the geographical
coordinates of the cities and their weather conditions(temperature, humidity, etc). 
In the second part of this project, I used GMaps API to create heatmaps for my cities from the WeatherPy activity. In this 
analysis I also used my code to narrow down my cities list to pull in cities that matched my desired weather conditions.
